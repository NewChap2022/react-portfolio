# React Portfolio

a personal portfolio conducted by React.

## Technologies
Javascript, React, Bootstrap, Bootswatch

## Reflection
Because the previous knowledge builds a solid foundation, I found it is easier to understand basic rules of React. But I think it takes more practice to use React in more complicated case.
